 * Circular Primes
 *
 * The number 197 is called a circular prime because all rotations of the
 * digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.
 *
 * There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37,
 * 71, 73, 79, and 97.
 *
 * How many circular primes are there below one million?
